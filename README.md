## Basics

### What is Object Oriented Programming?

- OOP is a programming methodology that utilizes 'objects'.
- These objects are a way to represent something in the real world.

There are many benefits of OOP such as:

- Code reusability, data redundancy, maintenance, security, problem solving, [polymorphism](Dictionary/Polymorphism.md), increased productivity.

### Classes & Objects

- Classes are like a blueprint of something in real life, such as a Car or a Student.
- Classes allow us to create instances(objects) of these representations.
- Classes contain properties (Car.Year, Car.Make, Car.Model), constructors, mutators
