# POCO
- Plain old CLR Object (CLR - Common Language Runtime)
  - Properties only, for "primitive" data types only (stuff supported by the CLR ex. int, double, string, datetime)
  
# DTO
- Data transfer Object
  - Just like a POCO except data types can be other classes

# CBO
- Custom Business Object
  - Like a DTO but with methods
